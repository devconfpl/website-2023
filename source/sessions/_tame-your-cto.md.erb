Engineer, let's step into the shoes ... of your CTO. We'll find out what CTOs do, how to become one, but also: how do they make decisions and evaluate performance, what are the traits they search for in devfolk, why deadlines are so important (or not) & how to communicate with CTO effectively. This is a session for both people who are intensively thinking about their future career ("CTO? Why not?") and those curious about secrets of high-performing organisations. It will be lead by hosts of CTO Morning Coffee, three industry veterans scarred for life with former leadership experience in companies i.a. Revolut, Amazon, and Microsoft.
