Join me on a journey through the history of software development as we explore how the rise of no-code platforms is changing the game for app developers worldwide. Gone are the days where a computer science degree or a large software house was necessary to build sophisticated apps. Modern no-code tools (now also powered by AI) allow anyone to create powerful, scalable applications without writing a single line of code.

In this presentation, we'll explore the benefits of no-code, including increased efficiency, enhanced accessibility, and democratization of software development.

As someone who has run a software house, created an AI-based startup, I'll share my current experience of building the whole company using a no-code stack. This presentation will showcase various tools, trends, and possibilities that will inspire attendees with the power and potential of no-code (from the perspective of developers) and how they can use it to power up their career.
