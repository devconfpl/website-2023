It's almost 15 years since the inception of DevOps. The core value of DevOps was to break down the silos and improve communication to achieve stability, reliability, availability, and security. In the boom of the ecosystem since that point, it sometimes feels like we've created more silos and stemmed communication in every way with the tooling we have. What if we take the lessons we’ve learned along the way and try to reimagine DevOps tooling to fulfill the original promise of the DevOps movement? What if we could remove the 200% problem (the need to know a specialist language AND a cloud framework) from our tooling? What if we could focus on delivery in a collaborative manner rather than communicating via a series of handoffs via pull requests? It’s time for a second wave of DevOps tools.

In this talk, Paul is going to reflect on the lessons we've learned along the DevOps journey, for example Infrastructure as Code, and talk about the work System Initiative is doing to revolutionize how people collaborate to build and maintain complex infrastructure. System Initiative is the beginning of an ecosystem to create a real-time, multiplayer, multi-modal reinvention of DevOps tooling. System Initiative provides a modern, state of the art approach to infrastructure management that increases productivity with its simulation-based workflow.

Once you see what it’s possible to achieve, you won’t want to settle any longer.
