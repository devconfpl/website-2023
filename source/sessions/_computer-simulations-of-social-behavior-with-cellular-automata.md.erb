Cellular automata - an underrated model useful in simulations and computer science. Extremely easy to develop and maintain, powerful in use and an interesting alternative for neural networks or complex machine learning methods. Try to use those simple cells with changing states and see how useful it is in solving social science issues like drug addiction or simulations of population shift and cultural changes!
