Startup's early days aren't easy: there are always too many topics on your plate and everything is of the highest priority. As a first-time CTO you have to pick your battles wisely - I'll try to help by sharing my experience as a former startup CTO and a person who cooperates with startups on daily basis. There is no single blueprint to follow, but we'll go through major decision points, key concerns to be addressed, most pressing questions to be answered. To illustrate the challenges covered and make it an interactive experience, we will create an artificial startup and take it for a virtual spin together.
