The first Law of Ecology: you can never merely do one thing. Actions have side-effects. In this session, we'll explore how changes in software design can have unexpected, profound impacts. In this story-based session, I'll reference both popular and little-known "laws" of computing and life. I'll show how to use these laws to write better software. This session will give you new mental models for thinking about the tradeoffs we make in software...and life.
