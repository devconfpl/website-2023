A story about how and why we moved to SPAs, later realized that there are some considerable drawbacks to this, and now gradually switching to new meta-frameworks that bring back the best of classical MPAs.

We look at the drawbacks of SPAs and the benefits of server-side rendering. Furthermore, we explore the long-forgotten art of progressive enhancement and why it is still important today.

Finally, we'll compare popular meta frameworks for React, Vue, and Svelte and their ups and downs. And we want to investigate how they can help us build better, more resilient applications faster.
