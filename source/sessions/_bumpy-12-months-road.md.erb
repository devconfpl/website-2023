Get ready for the story of how a team of over 20 people transformed their mindset and productivity approach in 12 months - from measuring success by lines of code and closed tickets to delivering value to customers based on behavioral data. We have gone from mercenaries to missionaries

How many times have you attended meetings filled with blame, arguments, and complaints? In my presentation, I will show how everything changed over 12 months. Our conversion rate improved by 5x, and in top markets by 6x. Our reliability increased by 90%, and we went from taking 4 weeks to deliver the smallest feature to just 2 days. We implemented Domain-Driven Design into our daily work, making every refinement session much more productive, with 100% engagement.
