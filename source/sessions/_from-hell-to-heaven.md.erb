Ever wondered how far we can push MAUI? How about making a C# version of the all-time classic game Doom into a cross-plaform version?

It all started with: "hey I'm porting Doom to C#, want to have a go at getting it to run on MAUI?".
Couple of weeks later there was something resembling Doom running on my phone, few months later and we have a fully playable game.

During this adventure I have hit a couple of limits of Microsoft's new cross-platform framework. In this session I'll explain the limits we've run into, the workarounds, and how much code we can actually share between the WPF version and the MAUI version of Doom.

This session has demons, in more than one way.
