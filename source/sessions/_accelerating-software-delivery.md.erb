Do bugs and technical debt make you want to pull your hair out? Does your backlog never seem to shrink but only grow? Do you plan dedicated sprints for bugs and/or technical debt?

Yes? Then this a session for you!

First of all, it is crucial to understand the effects of bugs and technical debt on our ability to deliver what we promised/planned (in time). How often have you not been able to complete your sprint goal because too much unaccounted work (bugs/incidents) popped up during the course of the sprint? Or how often have you 'almost' (so not) been able to deliver features by the end of the sprint because you just missed the weekly release window?...

Once we understand effects of bugs and technical debt we can move on to some simple rules or guidelines you can apply that will help you get a hold on your technical debt that keeps pilling on whilst slowing down your delivery frequency. And no... You should NOT organise a dedicated sprint for bugs and technical debt. It's the opposite...

During this session you'll also learn more about DevOps- and Lean principles like 'Good is good enough' or 'Decide as late as possible' and how these (attitudes) will accelerates your teams decisiveness and flow.

Join us and learn how to obtain a balanced delivery system for features, bug fixes and solving technical debt.
