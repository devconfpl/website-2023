InnerSource adopts OpenSource practices to code and helps reduce dependencies between development teams, break silos, as well as increases knowledge-sharing within the company. This approach can increase agility in your organization and take it to the next level.

During this session, I will present a real example of InnerSource implementation among 12 Agile teams in a department of over 100 software engineers at Grand Parade. Based on this experience, I will also highlight pros & cons of this practice - in what context InnerSource works and where it should be avoided.
