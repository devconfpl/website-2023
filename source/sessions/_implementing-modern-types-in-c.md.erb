For the last few years we have been doing all of our commercial work in the strongly typed functional programming language 'Purescript' on both the back-end and the front-end.

Rather than extol the virtues of the language I find myself working in to developers who are probably never going to give it a second glance, can we take some of these arcane powers and translate them to C#? The answer is a surprising 'yes'.

In this session, we'll look at some common solutions to problems in a functional language, and then do our best to implement those in C# to gain ourselves the compile time safety we deserve when building our software models.

Some of this code will not be pretty, and some of it may not be practical, but I will not be holding back and we will be hurtling into some fairly complicated examples at breakneck speed to generate some interesting conversations about what we expect our programming languages to give us and what exactly we mean by 'type safety'.
