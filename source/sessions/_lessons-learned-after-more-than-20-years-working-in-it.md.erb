When you arrive at a point in life when you have work colleagues whose dads are in the same age bracket than you, it’s time to reflect on the beginning of your career and think all the learning you have cumulated and all the advice you would have loved to hear on each stage of your professional career.

For each stage of my career, I will share with you the things I learned the hard way, so you don’t have to follow the same path full of dragons. I will cover my time as Junior Dev, Senior Dev, Team Lead, Project Manager and Agile & Transformation Consultant.
