In this proposed presentation, I aim to share practical insights under the theme 'Real Life Recipes.' As developers face increasing challenges in modern software development, these recipes offer tangible solutions backed by real-world examples from diverse domains like IoT, logistics and social media management.

The topics I will cover during my presentation:

1. High throughput event processing.
2. Designing horizontally scalable WebSocket services within Kubernetes.
3. Tackling subscription limits of the cloud provider - router/proxy pattern.
4. Creating resilient 'cron-like' job processing systems with 2 alternative solutions.

I will focus on exploring architectural decisions and strategies, emphasizing practical implementation over theoretical ideals. Where suitable, I'll supplement explanations with relevant TypeScript code examples to enhance comprehension.

Attendees will gain valuable insights into addressing common development challenges. While not universally prescriptive, these 'recipes' will encourage innovative thinking and empower developers to adapt and overcome specific hurdles.

My presentation aims to foster an environment of practical learning, enabling fellow developers to enhance their problem-solving skills within real-life contexts. I am eager to contribute to the conference program and engage with fellow professionals to collectively elevate our understanding of effective software development practices.
