In today's world of rich CI and infrastructure tooling, it's often easy to forget about elements of the UNIX philosophy:

“Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together.”

As it turns out, we can apply this philosophy to our build and CI/CD pipelines just as much as ever. In my personal journey, I've followed the bell curve from from basic building blocks, to rich, integrated systems, and all the way back down again.

Join me and learn how to pick the best building blocks for your build pipeline, with examples in C# and .NET, and above all—how to keep it simple.
