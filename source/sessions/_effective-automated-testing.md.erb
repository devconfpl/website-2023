Writing automated tests is hard. Why? Changing data, inconsistent behaviors, unreliable environments, tightly coupled code, and more. In this session, we'll explore approaches for overcoming these challenges and writing robust and comprehensive automated tests. Topics explored will include mocking HTTP calls, creating effective test data, choosing between testing paradigms like unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, and custom dev tools. After this session, you'll walk away with new patterns and tools for comprehensively testing your app.
