Software Engineers can easily be mistaken for rational, calculating and logical beings, just like the devices we perform our work on. We are however, like all humans, subject to many biases.

In this talk I share with you where these biases can really come back to bite us. I will give some practical examples of what to watch out for in your meetings, decision making and software design. I even have some stories of how my manager has used some of these biases against me!

The ideas behind this talk are set out in the books "How not to be wrong" and "Thinking fast and slow", which showcase how poorly human intuition works in specific cases. In this talk we will dive specifically into where these concepts can hurt or help us in Software Engineering.

Come join me in a session that is sure to be thought provoking!
