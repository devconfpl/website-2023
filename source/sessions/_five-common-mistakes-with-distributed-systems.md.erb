Does your system involve more than one computer? Then you have a distributed system. While distributed systems can be highly effective, it's easy to get things wrong. Sometimes, so wrong, it would be better to run everything on one big, expensive, machine. Usually this stems from one or more common mistakes, all of which I've made myself over the years, but as they sayâ€”learning comes from doing.

Join me and learn how to detect, avoid, and fix these mistakes and streamline your distributed systems for years to come.
