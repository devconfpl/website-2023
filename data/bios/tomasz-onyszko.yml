Host of CTO Morning Coffee, I share my knowledge and experience with technical leaders and aspiring ones in the tech industry.  He co-founded and holds the role of CTO of Predica Group, a company that he have been building and scaling for 14 years, with a team of over 400 people, now part of SoftwareONE Group.  In his professional settings, he has worked with enterprise organizations of 100k+ in size, leading consulting teams and architecture areas of projects.

He was awarded 14-time Microsoft MVP (now retired) and a Microsoft Regional Director, recognized for my technical excellence and community leadership. Spent countless hours on sharing knowledge, answering people questions and shitposting all over Internet.  Widely known in the community as a guy who missed out on all of DevConf editions so far.

You can find him at his blog, https://www.onyszko.com, Twitter profile (@tonyszko) and through generic search on Google for his name. In free time, marathon runner, books reader,  blogger, podcaster. 
He has opinions and do not hesitate to use them.
