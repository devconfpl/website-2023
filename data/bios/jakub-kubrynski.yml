I have been passionate about programming for almost 30 years. I started as a child, implementing in Fortran 77 simple programs to help me in my lessons - such as addition with carryover ;) Over 16 years ago my passion turned into a profession with which I am still involved. Initially as a programmer, then designer, architect, team leader, and manager, up to a trainer, consultant, and entrepreneur developing own company and DevSkiller.com product.
For years I've been focusing on the distributed systems architecture and tuning of software development processes, trying to do everything more efficiently and effectively. I support people with strategic consulting and IT processes audits.
