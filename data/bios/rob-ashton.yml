Rob is an ex-enterprise .NET consultant and has the scars to show for it - however for the last decade he has been working with a small (distributed) remote team as a full time Erlang+Purescript+Rust developer in the media streaming industry. 

Primarily residing in Glasgow and trying to resist the temptation to live on a diet of deep fried mars bars and whisky, he has tried on several hats outside of programming, entering barista competitions (where he tried to set the judges hair on fire), playing miserable country music at festivals (nobody got hurt - physically) and baking sourdough breads and pastries (gained 15kg over lockdown).

Now he's back to talk all things FP, surely nothing can go wrong.
