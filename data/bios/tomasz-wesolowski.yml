The founder of Cluee.app, a platform for no-code developers. In my free time I also help wannabe freelancers to become no-code pros :)

I spent six years as the CEO and co-founder of Edward.ai, where we built an AI assistant to support field sales reps. Before that, over a decade as the managing director of Empathy-Internet Software House and held the position of managing partner and board member at Unity Group.

I'm a big fan of exploring the intersection of human-computer interfaces, the future of work, and the ways in which no-code and AI can simplify and enhance our professional lives.
