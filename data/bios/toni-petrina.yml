SRE at Visma e-conomic, developer at heart and frequent speaker at conferences, user groups and local events. Started in QBasic, went through C++ to C#, finally settled in...full-stack? He spends most of the time at the keyboard typing yet another demo or application. If you take his keyboard away from him, he will talk endlessly about code...and functional programming. Been coding for over a decade to know if something is a programming fad or not. And no, functional programming is not a fad at all. Strong proponent of Open Source and all things chocolate.
