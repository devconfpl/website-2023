I am passionate about technology, programming, and building high-performing teams. My professional career in software development began in 2012 when I initially programmed solutions for civil engineering and geodesy.

Over the years, I wanted to have a significant impact on the software I was contributing to. I was passionate about searching for answers to questions on how to better organize teams to make product development more efficient. How to stop the constant blaming between people and show them what it's like to solve the problem of users with technology.

I went path from being a programmer, and individual contributor, through co-founder of a startup to leadership roles.

Currently, I'm Technical Tribe Lead where I help build efficient teams, I act as a consultant, mentor, architect, and programmer. All this to transform thinking from being mercenaries to missionaries.
